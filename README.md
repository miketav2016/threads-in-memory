# threads-in-memory

Design a database in memory that supports insert, delete, and update operations. Tuple of stored data KEY-VALUE.
The solution is in the form of a container &lt;map (unordered map)>.  Optimized implementation for work in a multithreaded environment.


The result should be:  
· Database implementation in the form of a template class, where you can optionally specify the type of the key and the value type. 

· Test application demonstrates the advantage of implementation over the standard std :: map.
